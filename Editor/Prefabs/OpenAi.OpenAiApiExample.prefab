        content: A wood chuck, also known as a groundhog, does not actually chuck
          wood. The phrase "how much wood would a woodchuck chuck" is a tongue twister
          and does not have a definitive answer. However, a wildlife biologist once
          calculated that a woodchuck could move about 700 pounds of dirt while digging
          a burrow, which is sometimes used as a playful answer to the question.

          do not actually chuck wood. However, a study by wildlife biologist Richard
          Thomas found that if a woodchuck could chuck wood, it might chuck approximately
          700 pounds of dirt to create its burrow. Using this information, one could
          humorously estimate that a woodchuck could potentially chuck 700 pounds
          of
